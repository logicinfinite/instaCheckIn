## Inspiration

Being a frequent traveler,we used to stand in the long queue for the check-in purpose. Rather than waiting along the line, they prefer to have a simple procedure that allows them to go directly to their room. Most of the hotels are still adopting the traditional way of check-in which will affect daily operations. Mobile check-in will free up staff time so that they can concentrate on delivering their service. During the covid-19 pandemic, we want to emphasize on contactless check-in where it benefits the hotel guests and hotel staff. 
To provide the leading edge platform to inspire hotel organizations in Malaysia and the Asean region to all business travellers, vacation travellers, families, tour group and handicapped guest
